# Access Control Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Access Control** smart contract provides a framework for managing access to digital resources through token-based payments on the Aptos blockchain. It allows resource owners to set access prices and enables users to pay for and gain access to these resources.

## Features

- **Create Resource**:

  - Allows owners to create a resource with a specified token access price.
  - Marks the resource as active upon creation.

- **Access Resource**:
  - Users can pay the required token price to access the resource.
  - Ensures that the resource is active before allowing access.

## Future Scope

1. **Access Management**:

   - Introduce roles and permissions to manage access at different levels or for different types of users.

2. **Resource Expiration**:

   - Implement expiration or time-limited access features for resources.

3. **Dynamic Pricing**:

   - Allow resource owners to set dynamic pricing or discounts based on various conditions.

4. **Access Logging**:

   - Develop features to log access transactions for auditing and tracking purposes.

5. **Resource Subscription**:

   - Implement subscription models for recurring access to resources.

6. **Enhanced Payment Options**:
   - Integrate support for multiple token types or payment methods for accessing resources.

The **Access Control** contract streamlines the process of monetizing digital resources, providing a secure and efficient way for owners to control access and for users to pay for and utilize valuable content or services.
